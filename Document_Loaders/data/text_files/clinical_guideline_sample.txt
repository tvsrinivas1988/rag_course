Title: Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus – Clinical Practice Guidelines (Excerpt)

Overview:
Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a chronic metabolic disorder characterized by insulin resistance and relative insulin deficiency. The goal of management is to achieve glycemic control, prevent complications, and improve quality of life.

Diagnosis Criteria:
- Fasting plasma glucose ≥ 126 mg/dL (7.0 mmol/L)
- 2-hour plasma glucose ≥ 200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L) during oral glucose tolerance test
- HbA1c ≥ 6.5%
- In a patient with classic symptoms of hyperglycemia, a random plasma glucose ≥ 200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L)

Treatment Goals:
- Maintain HbA1c < 7% for most adults.
- Individualize targets based on age, comorbidities, and risk of hypoglycemia.
- Blood pressure goal: < 130/80 mmHg.
- LDL cholesterol goal: < 100 mg/dL (<70 mg/dL in high-risk patients).

Lifestyle Modifications:
1. Encourage balanced diet emphasizing vegetables, whole grains, and lean protein.
2. Limit added sugars and processed carbohydrates.
3. Promote at least 150 minutes of moderate physical activity per week.
4. Support weight loss of 5–10% for overweight individuals.

Pharmacologic Therapy:
- First-line: Metformin unless contraindicated.
- Add-on agents based on comorbidities:
  • ASCVD → consider SGLT2 inhibitor or GLP-1 receptor agonist.
  • Heart failure → SGLT2 inhibitor preferred.
  • CKD → SGLT2 inhibitor or GLP-1 receptor agonist with proven renal benefit.
- Insulin therapy if HbA1c ≥ 10% or symptomatic hyperglycemia.

Monitoring:
- HbA1c every 3–6 months.
- Annual screening for retinopathy, nephropathy, and neuropathy.
- Foot examination at every visit.
